						<h3>About EZ Prospect</h3>
						<p>
							Started in November 2020, the idea of this application began many years prior by Adolfo
							Ospina while working in several roles in the banking industry. It was put into action as a
							final project to complete a Full Stack Junior Developer Certification Cohort through 4Geeks
							Academy. This application was brought to life by Adolfo and the talented Yahilyn Eizmendiz
							Yiong.
							<br />
							Today this application is presently linked by an API from Miami-Dade County, where most of
							its information is sourced from. EZ Prospect was designed to facilitate the process for
							financial representatives or banking relationship managers to easily source new prospects
							using data avaiable though public records.
							<br />
							Looking forward, we plan to grow this application, where it can be fully integrated with a
							banks operating system. Provide information from all public records to provide its user the
							most detailed and up to date information the user can get on their prospect.
							<br />
							As we grow, we hope you grow with us. Let us make your prospecting EZ.
